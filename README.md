# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Through the filtered data, the average donations can be seen, in addition, the launch date, categories, and the outliers, which helps see if the data is skewer or not. All of these highlights will ultimately help Louise build a successful campaign.
## Insight
Out of all the "Parent Category Outcomes" chart, theater outways all the other categories by a large margin making it the most successful out of all the other parent categories. In the subcategory the most successful were plays, with a total of 238 successful plays and 70 failed, with even 70 failed plays this outways the 18 or 19 other successful subcategories.

Breaking it down further the data from the based on launch date reveals that starting from May to June there is a peak, meaning if Louise started around that date the profits would be higher. And starting around September and December would be the worst times to launch.

By dividing the data into successful and failed we can compare some trends. Viewing the failed plays we see that the majority had an average goal of 10k, whereas successful plays averaged 5k and had an successful average pledge of 5.5k. The failed pledged only 500, but why so low, that would account for some of the outliers skewing the data. Seeing that most of the successful plays pledged 5k Louise's first proposal of 12k can be reconsidered to a lower amount if she wants to follow the data, with a maximum limit of 7.7k to get a pledge around 8.3k or lower. Also launching in May to June for the best possible outcome.
